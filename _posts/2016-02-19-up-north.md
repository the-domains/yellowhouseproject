Up North

For as long as I can remember, my grandparents took me to the cabin up north. That's what we called it, 
'Up North'. I loved going, sometimes with one of my brothers or sisters or just with my grandparents. It 
was an escape to another time and place; a one room cabin deep in the woods with no one around. Did I 
mention, there was no electricity or running water or toilet. Even growing up before I-pads and cell 
phones, getting away to an oil lamp, rustic, cabin was bliss. For my mom and siblings, this was where we 
learned to hike to get water from a spring, chop wood and make a fire in the stove, use an out-house, 
have family time and to entertain ourselves. I still appreciate it and go Up North with friends to get away 
and play gin-rummy and dominoes. Those great memories and relaxing times with my Grandparents, 
Mom, siblings and my daughter will always stay with me.
