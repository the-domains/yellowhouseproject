The Yellow House Project
April, 2010\. 

Real Simple magazine carries an ad for its essay contest. "What do you know about love?" I 
ponder the question. What do I know? Anything? The invitation is to write a 1500 word essay for a 
contest in which the winners will be published and go to New York to meet the Real Simple team and 
explore the city.
I am not interested in the trip; but I am interested in exploring the question. I call a few acquaintances, 
and we begin to meet once a month to talk about the topic and to develop our essays.The disussions are 
rich and with a clear goal in sight, we meet in September to send off our entries.
Over the next few years, we toyed with different projects. Life would get in the way of work between 
sessions and our writing would be off track, but there was a joy in coming together. Writing from the 
heart exposes vulnerabilities and feelings definitely hidden in daily life, sometimes even from ourselves. 
Eventually, we established a new format. We would come together. Literally. Sharing our lives and 
hopes and dreams. And then we would write for twenty minutes on the same topic and read our pieces 
out loud to each other.
